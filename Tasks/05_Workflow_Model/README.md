# CS513_Data_Cleaning_Final

The data wrangling pipeline was automated in a workflow wherein input files atr transformed through individual cleaning tasks. For each of these tasks, the data lineage and processing information is retained as provenance information, so that the entire cleanup workflow can be reproduced and audited. In this task, several of these workflow components and their provenance model were applied on data. 
The main tool used for generating workflow provenance diagrams was YesWorkflow Online Editor.
