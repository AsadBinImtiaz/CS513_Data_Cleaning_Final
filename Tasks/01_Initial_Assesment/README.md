# CS513_Data_Cleaning_Final

In this task, the structure and content on the dataset are inspected before starting with the data wrangling and provenance workflow, to get familiarity with data schema and a feel for apparent data quality issues present in the data. There may be more issues in data that would be discussed in subsequent chapters with corresponding tasks. 
The initial assessment was performed to get an understanding of the data quality in general and to identify methodology and tools for subsequent tasks. Scoped in this task was also an exploration of the data structures and types, and an understanding of the relationship among these entities.
